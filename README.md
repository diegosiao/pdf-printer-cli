# pdf-printer CLI

This is a small Windows CLI utility to print PDF files and take advantage of amazing NuGet package [PDFfoPrinter](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PDFtoPrinter).

To use this CLI just pass the path to the file and a valid local or network Windows Printer.

```bash
.\pdf-printer.exe file-1.pdf "HPF498BE (HP Ink Tank Wireless 410 series)"
```

Binaries comes in two .NET flavors:
